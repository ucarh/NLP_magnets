In order to get to those points and realize the substitution of GaN based UV-LEDs for the conventional UV-lamp sources, we must further improve the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and light output of UV-LEDs. One of the main factors that UV-LEDs yield low light output is associated with difficulty in obtaining highly reliable p-type ohmic electrodes, which have high transmittances over 70% and refractive index similar to that of GaN (n = 2.5). Currently, for fabrication of InGaN-based UV-LEDs, Pd-based semi-transparent electrodes as well as Ag-based reflective electrodes are widely used . However, these electrodes suffer from several problems, such as the absorption of a significant amount of light emitted from active layers and the low refractive index of the electrodes. Thus, to increase EQE of UV-LEDs, the development of p-type ohmic electrodes that have a high light transmittance and a refractive index similar to that of GaN is essential. To meet these conditions, TCOs such as indium tin oxides (ITO) should be considered as a transparent p-type electrode for UV-LEDs.

A silicon nitride (SiN) film with thickness of 150 nm and refractive index of about 2.4 was formed on n+ layer of pyramid-like shape by a low-pressure plasma chemical vapour deposition. Here, we used silicon substrates with thicker SiN films, which allowed us to grasp the etching state, easily. Additionally, 40-mm-square specimens were cut for experiments although the original size of a solar cell was 125\u00d7125 mm2. The arrangement of a stainless steel electrode whose one side is covered with a quartz glass layer having a convex part of 30 mm width, 60 mm length, and 9 mm height is a key to the surface discharge formation. The thickness of the quartz glass layer of the convex part was 1 mm. A cut specimen was sandwiched by the convex part and a stainless steel electrode of 70 mm diameter, and the silicon nitride surface faced the convex part. The height of a convex part of a dielectric electrode used in our previous study was only 5 mm, and dielectric barrier discharges were produced not only at the areas for electrode grooves but also at other areas at Vd=3.5 kV. For a newly designed dielectric electrode, dielectric barrier discharges were not be produced even at Vd=4.0 kV. That is, the surface discharges were formed only along boundary lines between the discharge electrode covered with the quartz glass and the silicon nitride film.

First, the LEE of a conventional planar GaN-based LED is limited by an internal reflection effect due to the large difference in the refractive index between the GaN (n = 2.5) and air (n = 1) . Second, it is well-known that there is a strong strain-induced piezoelectric polarization field in the conventional c-plane InGaN/GaN multi quantum well (MQW) active region due to the lattice mismatch between GaN and InN (of up to 11%). The piezoelectric polarization field results in a quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE), which can cause a red-shift in emission peak and a decrease in wave function overlap between the electron and the hole in a QW .

Current accumulation near the electrodes leads to a non-uniform current distribution across the device, which results in overheating of the active region, thus leading to decrease in emission efficiency of light at high operating current. Uniform current distribution in active region is quite important for improved LED performance. The light extraction efficiency had been the bottleneck of LED efficiency due to the relatively high refractive index semiconductors. The large difference in the refractive index between GaN (n = 2.3) and the surrounding air (n = 1) causes light emitted from the active region to be reflected internally and eventually to be absorbed back. Only 4% of emitted light from active layer can escape from LED because of low escape cone (23.6\u00b0) at the GaN-air interface . Hence, a great amount of photons emitted from the quantum wells are lost within the GaN layer due to light confinement and consequent re-absorption. Various methods have been anticipated to improve the light extraction efficiency of LEDs such as micro-patterning , nano-patterning , surface roughening , coating of porous films , photonic crystals , use of transparent conducting layers , current blocking layers , quaternary alloys and many more.

Indeed, Si technology continues to dominate the microelectronics market, providing a rigid substrate ideal for lithographic techniques. This will make possible the development of integrated devices in which sources, detectors and electronics, as well as ferroelectric and waveguiding components may be produced on the same wafer. Since the refractive index of Si (nSi\n= 3.42) is higher than the refractive index of LiNbO3 (nLiNbO3=2.2), an appropriate buffer layer with a smaller index is thus required between the substrate and the ferroelectric material to confine the waves in the active layer.

The SiO2 passivating layer was thinned to be 40 nm, as a compromise between the coupling and scattering behaviour of the Ag surface plasmons and the surface passivation provided by the SiO2 layer. The plasmon resonance is sensitive to the surrounding medium and is red-shifted to longer wavelengths with increased effective refractive index due to depolarisation effects . Hence 10 nm ZnS which has a refractive index of 2.2 was used to overcoat the nanoparticles by inducing a change in refractive index of the surrounding medium. Note: the \u201cback reflector\u201d, as illustrated in (b), is absent in variations 1, 2 and 5, but is present in variations 3 and 4 as a detached Al reflector layer and in variation 6 as an evaporated Al layer.

Increasing the amount of 8OH-POSS above 25% in weight resulted in the excess of 8OH-POSS being exuded from the sample. Films 1 m thick were obtained by spin coating (1000 rpm, 30 s) the polymer solution onto quartz substrates and left at room temperature for several minutes to remove the remaining solvent. We have found no way to measure directly the refractive index of the hybrid matrix since the film surface is rough and this leads to errors when using, for example, variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE). We have estimated it taking into account that the refractive index of pHEMA is 1.51, and the one of 8OH-POSS is close to this value, as we have shown previously . Then, the mixture of both must have a refractive index \u223c1.51.

To minimize reflection loss at the glass/AZO interface, the ARL requires a refractive index of about 1.67, which was calculated by finding the geometric mean of the two surrounding indices (i.e. n1=n0n2 where n0=1.5 (glass), n2=1.87 (AZO)). The refractive index of the deposited Al2O3 (1.69) is very close to the optimum value (1.67).

For both methods, the overall light transmission is determined by a combination of light absorption, reflection and scattering processes. Light reflection and scattering is proportional to the square of the difference in refractive index (RI) of the exine and surrounding medium and so is significant for sporopollenin exines in air when the RI difference between the exine and surrounding medium is large. As reported in Ref. , sporopollenin exines are approximately refractive index matched to their surrounding fluid when dispersed in glycerol (RI = 1.475 ). Hence, light transmission of sporopollenin is expected to be determined almost entirely by absorption when the exines are dispersed in either glycerol or toluene (RI = 1.496 ) which both have RI values close to that of sporopollenin.

Daniela et al. reported that the refractive index of RF-sputtered ZnO thin film increased with the increase in annealing temperature which was due to a decrease in the porosity of the films . This could be attributed to the changes in packing density within the film and slight increases in the arc-ZnO:TiO2 crystallinity. It is worth noticing that the effective refractive index of ITO glass (i.e., 1.78) still lies below the index of the ITO/arc-ZnO:TiO2 samples.
