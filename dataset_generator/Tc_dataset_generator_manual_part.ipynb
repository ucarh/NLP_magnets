    "#### This notebook generates rather manually the QA dataset used in training the QA pipeline. There are about 1200 sentences that either mentions Tc or not. The answer is structured much like the SQUAD dataset with answer start, length of answer. We are also appending a \"no-answer\" at the end of each sentence and for sentences that do not mention Curie temperature, \"no-answer\" is picked for the answer."
